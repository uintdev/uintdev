# Hello. 👋

I am a software developer and graphic designer.
Developing and testing the security of software and websites.

I work on software that simplifies tasks while having good looks & modern functionality. This includes full-fledged tools and some experiments. That, while getting to know existing and new technologies along the way.

What else do I do?

-   Create graphics 🎨
-   Administrate Linux and Windows (servers) 💻
-   Find software bugs 🐛
-   Investigate & resolve or workaround technical issues 🛠
-   Work with electronic components ⚙
