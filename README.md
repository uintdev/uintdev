# Hello. 👋

I'm a software developer and graphic designer. 
Developing and testing the security of software and websites.

I work on software that makes life easier with fancy & modern functionality. Full-fledged tools and experiments. While getting to know existing and new technologies along the way.

What else do I do?
- Create illustrations, noticeably for the more recent projects 🎨
- Administrate GNU/Linux servers 💻
- Find software bugs (or, "unintentional features") 🐛
- Investigate & resolve or workaround technical issues 🛠
- Work with electronic components ⚙
## Toolkit

To give an idea of how I use some technologies...

| Go             | CLI & cross-platform applications     |
| Flutter (Dart) | Mobile, web & desktop applications    |
