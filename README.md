# Hello. 👋

I develop and test the security of software and websites. 🛠

I also:
- Create illustrations, noticeably for the more recent projects 🎨
- Administrate GNU/Linux servers 💻
- Find software bugs (or, "unintentional features") 🐛
- Investigate & resolve or workaround technical issues 🔧
- Work with electronic components ⚙

## Technologies

To give an idea of how I use some technologies, here is a table:

| Framework or language(s) | Details                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go                       | Used for more serious projects -- usually CLI and can be cross-platform           |
| Flutter (Dart)           | Mobile applications -- soon, desktop and web too                                  |
| Python                   | Commonly used to quickly create tools or test ideas -- more for experienced users |
| C/C++                    | Primarily CLI and not used as much as the others                                  |
| MySQL                    | Typically used in web-related projects involving a database                       |
| JavaScript               | In-browser and with Node.js                                                       |
| Sass                     | CSS but in a more sane style.. well, when using the SCSS syntax, anyway           |
| HTML & CSS               | Website structure and design, along with modern features                          |
