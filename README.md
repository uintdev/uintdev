# Hello. 👋

I'm a software developer and graphic designer. 
Developing and testing the security of software and websites.

I work on software that makes life easier and have fancy & modern functionality. Full-fledged tools and experiments. While getting to know existing and new technologies along the way.

What else do I do?
- Create illustrations, noticeably for the more recent projects 🎨
- Administrate GNU/Linux servers 💻
- Find software bugs (or, "unintentional features") 🐛
- Investigate & resolve or workaround technical issues 🛠
- Work with electronic components ⚙
## Toolkit

To give an idea of how I use some technologies...

| Technologies   | Use case                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go             | CLI, cross-platform and standalone applications           |
| Flutter (Dart) | Mobile, web and desktop applications                      |
| Python         | Often used to produce quick tools and prototype           |
| C/C++          | Lower-level development                                   |
| MySQL          | Database management -- usually used with web applications |
| PHP            | Commonly used backend for web applications                |
| JavaScript     | Web applications (in-browser) and with Node.js            |
| Sass           | Cleaner and convenient CSS-based syntax                   |
| HTML & CSS     | Structuring and styling of web applications               |
